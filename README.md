# MTA-Route-Planning-Project
● Coordinated with a team of two to develop a Java program to efficiently calculate the shortest subway route, enabling dynamic and optimal navigation within MTA Subway system by using Breadth-First Search algorithm.

● Implemented MTA Subway station data to create an efficient representation of the subway network, ensuring optimized station connections and pathfinding capabilities from a CSV file that was organized into an adjacency list data structure.

● Organized a report, summarizing pre-coding plans, method descriptions, and key insights into the implementation for a clear understanding of the project's functionality.
